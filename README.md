<h2>:rocket:Getting started</h2>

First, you need to create your own Telegram bot.
This process only takes about 3 minutes and can be done by writing to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
Follow the instructions to create a new bot and set it up as desired.
If you need more information about creating your own Telegram Bot, you can find it on the telegram official website.

Next, obtain your Bot token and Chat ID from the bot you created. These values are required to configure the plugin.
You can get a bot token through @BotFather. Getting a Chat ID is a bit more complicated: 
Go to https://api.telegram.org/bot{YourBotToken}/getUpdates, and replace {YourBotToken} with your actual token.
You should see something like "chat":{"id":261860914, copy the "id" number (261860914) - this is your chat ID.

Fill these in the plugin settings and add other information as you choose.

After configuring the plugin, reload it and that's it!

To create scheduled notifications, simply add the "scheduled"
property to your file (or use your own if you've changed it in the settings). 
Also, you can add the data directly in the body of the file, preceded by ðŸ“… (which can be changed in the settings as needed).

### Tips

The best way for me is to use note properties as far as you
can simply pick a date via UI, using the native Obsidian properties feature.

Otherwise, if you need to insert an inline date, it would be convenient for you to use 
the [Date Inserter plugin](https://github.com/namikaze-40p/obsidian-date-inserter).

The Date Inserter plugin provides a user interface for inserting inline dates. 
To make your experience even better, you can configure it a little by copying 
your Schedule Inline Prefix of the Telegram Notifier plugin 
into the Date Format field of the Date Inserter plugin. 
This will allow you ability to insert the entire date template
within a single shortcut and simple user interface. 
Additionally, you can change the shortcut in the Date Inserter's settings.
