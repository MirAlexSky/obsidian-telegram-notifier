<h2>:rocket:Getting started</h2>

First, you need to create your own Telegram bot. It takes you about 3 minutes. 
All you need to do is write to @BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather) 
and create a new bot using the /newbot command.
Set it up as you see fit. If necessary, you can find out more about creating your
own Telegram Bot. 

Next, get your Bot token and Chat ID. 
Fill these in the plugin settings and add other information as you choose. 

That's it! Reload the plugin and enjoy. 

To create scheduled notifications, add the 'scheduled' property to the file (or insert your own property if you've changed it in the settings). Or, you can add the data directly in the file body, preceded by ðŸ“… (which you can change in the settings if needed).
