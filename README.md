<h2>:rocket:Getting started</h2>
First, you need to create your own telegram bot, it takes you about 3 minutes, 
everything you need is write to @BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather), 
create new bot via /newbot command and set it up as you like. You can find actual information 
about creating telegram bot yourself if necessary.

Next step, get your bot token and chat id. Fill them in plugin settings and fill others by your chose.

That's all, reload plugin and enjoy!

To create a scheduled notification, add 'scheduled' property to the file (or 
insert your own property, if you have changed it in settings). 
Or you can add date right inside file body prepositioned with ðŸ“… (you can change it in settings)
